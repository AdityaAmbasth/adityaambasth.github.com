		<h4 class="abstract_word">Abstract</h4>
		<p class="publication_abstract">
			About 8% of India’s population is multiply disabled of which major sections constitute of women due to lower literacy rate, social factors and lower grade health facilities. In this paper we review a few existing models to aid people with speech disability. Further we explore a novel approach based on gesture recognition to mitigate few shortcomings described above. Finally we give a solution which will address most of the problems enumerated in this paper to help the speech disabled people living in developing nations to uplift their daily living and also become economically independent which would in turn help the overall development of the nation.

			We here intend to develop an external portable wireless data storage hard-drive as an interfacing device with other secondary storage present in laptop or desktop. Thereby attaining lightning fast data transfer at speeds, when compared to present day external hard drives. Using fast switching LED’s to transfer electronic data that can be written wirelessly, instead of trivial electronically transferred files through low speed existing wireless standards such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth etc.

		<h4 class="abstract_word">Abstract</h4>
		<p class="publication_abstract">
			 In this paper we describe a novel approach to
			shopping using the classic shopping cart with few modifications
			to the same. The need for a new approach arises from the
			dissatisfaction of customers due to cumbersome experience
			during shopping. Shopping in supermarket can be eased by using
			a smart device with front camera attached to the cart to read the
			barcode of the product. To ensure security and reliability, a few
			modifications have been introduced to the cart and a recharge
			system for the payment has been proposed. A Java based
			application was developed to test the proposed method and cart
			modeling was done incorporating the changes. This method
			proves to provide a better shopping experience to the user and
			also increase productivity and profitability at the supermarket.
