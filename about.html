<p class="about_content">
	Back in the year of 2k, when desktop computers were finding its way in the society and just making it to our homes. I happened to be one among the very few to possess a Intel Pentium-4 version of it. Thanks to my tech savvy father for his knack of lore towards this magical instrument. Tunneling almost 16 years from then, now I shall be completing my undergraduate in Computer Science and engg and realizing the dream that I once had.

<p class="about_content">
While being in undergrads, I picked up academic topics related to Computer Networks, Operating system, Software development and many more. Where I started researching and getting my hands-on, on variety of new tools through group and individual projects. Somehow, Natural Language Processing and Information retrieval web systems found to be intriguing in more than many possible ways. It opened the doors to assistive technologies, linguistic challenges, data corpuses on one hand. Parallely, giving the insights of building Search Engines and its multifactor components, on the other. Working on large data sets became fun and equally challenging. To know more, read through my experience section.
